# IP Cloud Rails Base Image

This docker repository is built up out of several branches, each representing a
different ruby and/or deployment version. This repository offers:

- Deployment environment
- Development environment
- on-build environment

# Usage

You can use the base image (i.e. 2.x) as a base for your own Ruby on Rails
application. Here you'll have to write your own Dockerfile to deploy your app

Optionally you can also use the `onbuild-2.x` branches to use the provided
 packaging options. You only need to create the following `Dockerfile` to build
 your container:

 ```
 FROM ipcloud/rails:onbuild-2.x
 ```
